# CTF Writeup 2017 :: Angstrom, Binary, 80, ART OF THE SHELL
A fun little beginner CTF which I did in April.


# Original Description

ART OF THE SHELL
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BINARY, 80

Looks like this program has a buffer overflow vulnerability! But there's no code inside that spawns a shell, so it must be secure! Get the flag anyway by exploiting it on our shell sever. The problem is available as: binary and source.
